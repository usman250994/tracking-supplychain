# .NET Unchained

This project is a modern web development framework, it uses .NET core for the backend and Angular 1 for the frontend. This project comes out of the box with an admin panel and some very cool plugins, both for frontend and backend.
On the backend we have got:
    Swagger (For debugging REST APIs)
    Entity framework SQL-SERVER (ORM)
    .NET Dependence Injection (Keeps code clean and mean!)

On the frontend we have:
    Angular 1 (Yep!)
    angular-datatables
    ui.router
    angular-jquery-locationpicker (The most awesome location picker widget)
    ngMap (google maps)
    flatpickr (An awesome date/time picker)
    chosen-ajaxified (A drop down manager that uses ajax for querying data as the user types)
    
    
    
    ##Description about the project
    I was trying to create a system where we can track different vehicles , people using a simple application and gps in their cell phones, and will then display their time to reach destination and more. As currently careem does. 
    The purpose was to create a supply chain system for the tradeers like TCS , dhl and more..   sort of a stratup idea. 
    
    The code isnt complete but here just for ref.
    
    
    I used googles distance api and angularjs for it. I used android phones to install application that can track gps location and tos end that to nosql servers like firebase and more.
